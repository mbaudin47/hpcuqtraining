Reliability

1) How many evaluations would you need to compute a probability of failure of approximatively 10^-4 with a brute Monte Carlo approach with a coefficient of variation of 10%?
	10 000
	1 000 000
	100 000 000

2) Let f(x) be the PDF of x, let F be the failure domain and let h(x) be the instrumental probability distribution used for Importance Sampling. What is the requirement for h(x):
	h(x) = 0 => I_F(x)f(x) = 0
	h(x) > 0 => I_F(x)f(x) > 0
	I_F(x)f(x) = 0 => h(x) = 0 

3) In the FORM/SORM framework, the PDF of gÂ°(u) in the standard space is :
	Multivariate and uniformely distributed 
	Multivariate and normally distributed with an identity covariance matrix
	Multivariate and normally distributed with a case dependent covariance matrix

4) The most probable failure point in the standard space is :
	The point of the failure region closest to the origin
	The point of the failure region furthest from the origin
	The point of the failure region where the constraint gradient is the largest

Optimization

5) A local optimum is characterized by a positive gradient vector and a null Hessian matrix (matrix containing the 2nd order derivatives)
	True
	False
	
6) Gradient-descent based methods are most suitable when dealing with multiple local optima
	True
	False

7) If a function is strictly convex, it has a single local optimum equivalent to the global optimum
	True
	False

Calibration

8) In the calibration framework, the standard hypothesis considers the observation errors as
	Independent and identically normally distributed
	Independent and identically uniformely distributed
	Normally distributed, with a user-defined covariance matrix

9) Let us consider the calibration of g(x,theta). The application of the linear least squares approach implies the following hypothesis :
	g() is linear w.r.t. x
	g() is linear w.r.t. theta
	g() is linear w.r.t. both x and theta

10) When performing Gaussian Bayesian calibration, the following hypothesis is made:
	The prior p(theta) is Gaussian
	The likelihood p(y|theta) is Gaussian
	Both the prior and the likelihood are Gaussian
